# Sona

Sona is a html/cs/js based instrument.

It was built using the [OscillatorNode()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode) web API, and should work on most modern web browsers.

## How to Use

Open the html file in a web browser and click the notes to play.
The Capital letters are the Notes on a C Major Scale, the lowercase letters are keys you can press on your computer keyboard to play.
